<p>I am Keith. I am really big. Tall is more of an aspiration or a goal of mine. See, when a large person enters a room, some people look at them and think, “Wow, that’s a big dude!” or “Wow, that’s a tall dude!” I am working on my fitness so that when I enter a room, people think the latter.

This blog is about me and my journey to a new career as a web developer. I am currently learning Ruby on Rails at Tech Talent South in Atlanta. Some of my personal stories might creep in from time to time, so forgive me if that is a little less technical than you were expecting.

The idea is for me to post my code examples here as a sort of evolving portfolio for potential employers to see where my skills started, where they have gone, and the direction they are taking. Any potential employers, please feel free to send me emails and make high paying job offers, or medium paying job offers… Lets be honest, I would settle for a low paying job offer if it meant I could get my foot in the door to the tech world.</p>
