			<h3><u><%= link_to "Where are the MARTA Buses?", blogs_samplejson_path, :target => "_blank" %></u></h3>
				<p>This nifty little app will show you every single MARTA bus in service at that time. Sometimes, the MARTA API provides some wacky data <u><%= link_to "(A bus in the middle of the ocean?)", welcome_galapagos_path, :target => "_blank" %></u>, which can be thoroughly entertaining. Unless, of course the bus you are waiting on is off the coast of the Galapagos Islands. Parts of this app were built as a project while at <u><%= link_to "Tech Talent South", "http://techtalentsouth.com/", :target => "_blank" %></u>.</p>
				<p>Built with <u><%= link_to "Gmaps4Rails", "http://apneadiving.github.io/", :target => "_blank" %></u>, this app makes a JSON call to the <u><%= link_to "MARTA API", "http://www.itsmarta.com/developers/default.aspx", :target => "_blank"%></u> and returns the lattitude and longitude of the buses. Then, these points are plotted on a customized google map. </p>

			<h3><u><%= link_to "What is your home REALLY worth?", "http://bakersfieldhomeworth.herokuapp.com", :target => "_blank" %></u></h3>
				<p>A realtor in California asked me to create an app that would allow potential customers to find out how much their home was worth. Along with an eye catching design, this app features a custom postgres interface, allowing the realtor to see the leads in a table.</p>
				<p>Built with <u><%= link_to "JQuery-Datatables-Rails", "https://github.com/rweng/jquery-datatables-rails", :target => "_blank" %></u>, <u><%= link_to "Rubillow", "https://github.com/synewaves/rubillow", :target => "_blank" %></u>, and <u><%= link_to "Gmaps4Rails", "http://apneadiving.github.io/", :target => "_blank" %></u>, this app first asks for the desired address, then shows the user a map of the address and asks them for their contact information. After they enter their info, the value of the house is shown and an email is sent to the user as well as the realtor.</p>

				<p>When you just can't get enough pinterest, what should you do? Why, build your own Pinterest app, of course. The app utilizes <u><%= link_to "Paperclip", "https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip", :target => "_blank" %></u>, <u><%= link_to "Amazon Web Services", "http://aws.amazon.com", :target => "_blank" %></u> for image hosting, as well as <u><%= link_to "Devise", "https://github.com/plataformatec/devise", :target => "_blank" %></u> for user authentication. Feel free to browse the pictures that have been posted. If you are feeling frisky, you can go ahead and create an account and upload some fun pictures yourself!</p>
				<p>The front end was developed using <u><%= link_to "Twitter Bootstrap", "http://getbootstrap.com", :target => "_blank" %></u> with just a touch of Javascript thrown in for good measure. This app was built as a part of the <u><%= link_to "One Month Rails", "https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails/", :target => "_blank" %></u> course.</p>
