# My Awesome Portfolio site.

I have been working on this site for quite a while now. It will go through constant iterations and change quite frequently.

There are a few pages of interest, namely the MARTA app I built. It shows the location of every MARTA bus running at that time on a google map. Oh yeah, I also used Gmaps4Rails in this app.
